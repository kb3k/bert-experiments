# bert-experiments

## Step 1. Set-up for ipykernel virtual environment. 
### Call it bert-experiments.
python3 -m pip install ipykernel
python3 -m ipykernel install --name bert-experiments
python -m ipykernel install --user

## Step 2. Activate a venv perhaps
### Also called bert-experiments.
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
python3 -m venv bert-experiments
source bert-experiments/bin/activate

## Step 3. Install requirements
### Please wait up to 5-10 minutes for completion.
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

## Step 4. Run a jupyter notebook.
### Make sure to use the bert-experiments kernel.
Using bert-experiments kernel & using the bert-experiments virtual environment.

## Step 5. Try it out.
### To test your code, compare how your model does with mine!
